## yaml basics
* a small quirk to yaml, a yaml file start with `---` , end with `...`, eg:
```
---
# an example yaml file
fruit:
    - apple
    - orange
    - peral
    - mango
...
```

* yaml comments use `#`

* yaml list, all list member with same indentation level starting with (a dash and a space) `'- '`, eg:

```
fruit:
    - apple
    - orange
    - strawberry
    - grape
```

* yaml dictionary, represent simple `key: value`, (a colon must follow by a space) `': '`, eg:
```
# an employee record
jack:
    name: jack huge
    job: se
    skill: running
```

* more compleate example, mix list and dictionary.
```
# epmloyee record
- jack:
    name: jack huge
    job: dev
    skill:
        - swim
        - cook
        - ski
- make:
    name: mike D
    job: dj
    skill:
        - sing
        - speak
        - laugh
```

* abbreviate format for map and list, eg
```
martin: {name: uncle martin, job: driver, skill: excellent}
fruit: ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
```

* bool value in yaml
```
create_key: yes
needs_agent: no
knows_oop: True
likes_emacs: TRUE
uses_cvs: false
```

* span multi lines use `|` or `>` , use `|` include new lines, use `> ` ignore new lines.

```
include_newlines: |
            exactly as you see
            will appear these three
            lines of poetry

ignore_newlines: >
            this is really a
            single line of text
            despite appearances
```

* for literal "yes", "no", "true", "false", use quote

```
value: "true"
flag: "false"
```

* for string "1.0", use quote
```
version: "1.0"
```
